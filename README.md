# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is World Cup Data which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshatkjain/icc-world-cup-2007-2023-over-by-over-summary)


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * How to visualize the winning score/stats for a team
 * How to calculate the run rate for the line graph
 * Is there any interesting relation between Over Number and Wickets Taken?
 * As given to me in a feedback will try to make the landing page more interesting and fun!

## Sketches

[![image](https://github.com/parth-1023/dataviz-project-template-proposal/blob/master/sketches.jpg)]

 * The sketches show how the interaction would work as I have imagined it.
 * First the user woud see a world map and zoom over the regio he clicked on. (This has been changed in the implemented version as now I am showing a globe with zooming and panning)
 * Then he would be presented with different stadiums all over the country, which he would click on and see different matches.
 * After clicking on a match he would be presented with a line graph.


## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a line graph and it shows relation between Runs and Overs.

## Open Questions
I am not sure whether I will be able to interact with the world map as I want to. I want to have the outline of the countries where the world cup happened after I hover over them and zoom into them after I click on them.
I will try to implemet this but if not then I might implememt a "poor man's version of this idea".

## Milestones

 * Week 1:
   Try to make the landing page with the world map.(Implemented this)
 * Week 2:
   Will try to add interaction to different maps. Also make the new database
 * Week 3:
   Try to add hover and click events in the visualization.
 * Week 4:
   Implement line graph and its feature.
 * Week 5:
   Final touches
